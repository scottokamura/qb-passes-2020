This repo contains a NFL quarterback pass completion prediction model for __front office__ and __coaching staff__ members to assist with team building as well as game prep/film watching. The two proposed models can assist in different scenarios:
1. Signing or re-negotiating a QB contract
2. Preparing against opponent QB
